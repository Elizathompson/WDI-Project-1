### Game overview
Pac Man is my own re-creation of the classic Pac Man arcade game. The aim of the game is to eat all of the food on the board while gaining as many points as possible, while avoiding the ghosts.

If Pac Man eats a flashing superfood this turns the ghosts blue. Bonus points can be gained by eating the ghosts while they are blue.

### Controls
- Pac Man movements: ← ↑ → ↓ keys

### Game Instructions
1. The game begins with a welcome modal which introduces the game as well as providing instructions. The game is started by clicking on the "Start Game" button.

2. After the start button has been clicked a 3 second countdown begins and shows on the screen. The keys are disabled during the countdown, once the countdown has finished the game starts and the player can begin moving Pac Man.


3. Points are gained every time Pac Man eats food.
